      Creating and Defending Against Netcat Backdoor Shells with Named Pipes

    During the SANS SEC504 (Hacker Tools, Techniques, and Incident Handling) course, I learned how attackers use Netcat to create backdoor login shells, reverse shell backdoors, transfer files, and cause other mischief.

    I created several VMs in Proxmox to learn how RITA detects C2 beaconing traffic, but I first wanted to practice using Netcat to create a backdoor login shell and a reverse shell backdoor. However, Ubuntu no longer supports the <code>-e</code> switch due to security restrictions. To work around this, I used the <code>mkfifo</code> command to create a named pipe — explained in detail below.

    Finally, I share steps defenders can take to prevent, detect, and mitigate Netcat-based reverse shells using named pipes.
